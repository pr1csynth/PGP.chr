# PGP.chr

PGP.chr is a Chrom* extension to encrypt and decrypt messages and manage public and private keys, all in your browser using OpenPGP.js

## Why ?

Because NSA are looking at me right now.

## What is planned ?

- Scan for public and private keys, for encrypted (and signed) messages. **(done)**
- Import public and private keys.
- Encrypt and sign, decrypt and verify messages.

## And what is not ?

- Clear signatures
- Key generating or signing (use GnuPG instead)
